# Open-Development
We are doing research on Mathematical analysis for natural sciences. This research will develop the analytical process of natural sciences like Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Social data analysis. Our primary goal is using analytical methods on Astronomical data analysis and develop Stellar formation, galaxy formation process etc. Then we will move to other scientific fields.

# Our Data Distribution
Our data will be used for different analytical methods so it is important for data analysis and modelling these data. Then we will open our result for all of the development related individuals, organizations, institutions etc. We will also help them for further research to develop more by scientific collaboration.
